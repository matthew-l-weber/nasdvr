I have only tested this on the Buffalo LS-WXL.  I don't know if
it works on any other models.  I also only have one lineup with Schedules Direct
and it is an OTA lineup.  So I don't know if anything works properly with cable
stations.

- Obtain root access to LS-WXL.

  . See http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/Category:LS-WXL#Gain_Root_Access

- Install nasdvr-0.2 directory to /mnt/array1/share

- Run chmod -R nobody on the nasdvr-0.2 directory

- Run chmod 777 nasdvr-0.2/dat

- Run chmod 755 nasdvr-0.2/bin/*.pl

- Run chmod 755 nasdvr-0.2/cgi-bin/*.cgi

- Copy the files in arm-bin to /usr/bin

- Change to the nasdvr-0.2/sql directory

- Enable Web Server

  . Log into LS-WXL admin screen from a web browser
  . Go under the Network > Web Server menu
  . Enable, point at share/nasdvr-0.2 and save

- Enable Media Server

  . Log into LS-WXL admin screen from a web browser
  . Go under the Extensions > Media Server menu
  . Enable and Save

- Enable MySQL database server

  . Log into LS-WXL admin screen from a web browser
  . Go under the Network > MySQL Server menu
  . Enable and select MySQL root directory
  . Save
  
- Create the nasdvr database

  . Enter: mysql -u admin -ppassword (password is your admin password on the LS-WXSL)
  . Enter: create database nasdvr
  . Enter: \q
  . Enter: mysql -u admin -ppassword nasdvr < base.sql
  . Enter: mysql -u admin -ppassword nasdvr < p1.sql
  
- Download and install the following packages from CPAN

   CGI
   Date::Calc
   SOAP::Lite
   XML::Twig

- Change to the nasdvr-0.2/lib directory

- Edit the config.pm file and set your admin username and password

- In your web browser enter the URL that points to your new install

  . http://192.168.1.1:81/nasdvr-0.2 (enter appropriate host IP address and port)
  
- Click on the Tuners link

- Click the "Scan" button and make note of the ID returned

- Click on the Configure link

- Enter the HDHomeRun ID in the hdhr_id field

- Enter your Schedules Direct username and password in sd_username and sd_password

- Enter you timezone offset from GMT in tz_offset

- Click the Tuners link and then click the Scan button.  This process
  will take a while to complete.  After it is done, you should see all
  the stations found by your HDHomeRun on both tuners.
  
- Change directory to nasdvr-0.2/bin

- Run sd.pl.  This will populate your listings database.

- Edit the root crontab

  . Enter: crontab -e
  . Add the following lines
  
    00 0 * * * cd /mnt/array1/share/nasdvr-0.2/bin;./sd.pl
    * * * * * cd /mnt/array1/share/nasdvr-0.2/bin;./scheduler.pl

  . This will run the Schedules Direct updater once a day and
    the program scheduler once per minute.
    
You should be ready to start scheduling shows!!

Use your favorite uPNP client device to watch recordings.

<b>Note:</b> You can create a symbolic link to your install dir from
nasdvr-0.2 to nasdvr if you want to make it easier to upgrade to future
versions.  Then you don't need to change your configuration settings, etc.
If you do this, then you need to edit the /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf file
and set server.follow-symlink = "enable".
